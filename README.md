# DATA-ANALYSIS-DASHBOARD
This repository hosts a web-based Data Analysis Dashboard, inspired by Power BI's capabilities. It allows users to upload CSV or Excel files for data exploration and visualization.

Features:

1)Powerful Data Preprocessing: Missing values are filled with zeros, and numeric columns are appropriately converted to float data types.

2)Interactive Visualizations: Create Line, Bar, Scatter, Pie, Doughnut, Gauge, and Funnel charts effortlessly.

3)Power Query & Power Pivot: Perform data transformations and modeling operations seamlessly.

4)Upload & Analyze: Upload files, visualize, and gain insights directly from the web browser.

5)User-Friendly: Intuitive interface for selecting visualization options and interacting with visualizations.

Note:
This project uses Python, Plotly, and Pandas libraries to handle data preprocessing and generate dynamic visualizations, enabling users to perform data analysis tasks similar to Power BI's capabilities.
